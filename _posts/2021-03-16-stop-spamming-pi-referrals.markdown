If you have ever watched a video related to the Pi Network, you have probably noticed one thing\: The comment section is full of people pushing their referral codes.

And if you are already a member of the Pi Network, you might be tempted to do the same yourself.

Here are 3 reasons why you should not give in to that temptation\:

- We are all Pioneers here.\
Well, maybe not all, but most people watching Pi-related videos have already joined the network. They would be unable to join your earning circle even if they wanted to.

- It is very offputting to non-members (as well as other members).\
Are you familiar with multi-level marketing? If so, you might know how annoying multi-level marketers can get while trying to get others to join their downline.
Well, that's exactly how you will look if you start copy-pasting your referral code all over the place. Not to mention it makes Pi look less-than-trustworthy in the process.

- You are unlikely to get referrals that way.\
For the upper two reasons, you are unlikely to succeed in convincing enough people to join your earning team - and it will most certainly not be as effort-efficient as simply pressing the mining button once a day.

So, you are better off just filling your security circle (which you can do with existing members) and pressing the button once a day. But if you want some possibly useful advice on how to earn more Pi efficiently, I plan to release another article on the topic within a week.
