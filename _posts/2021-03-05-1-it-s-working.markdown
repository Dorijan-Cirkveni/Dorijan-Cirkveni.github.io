Okay, so I managed to get the blog up and I changed the URL so it doesn't collide with any other stuff I might upload on Github.

Okay, so I managed to get the blog up and I changed the URL so it doesn\'t collide with any other stuff I might upload on Github.

I am currently using [this Markdown editor](https://markdown-editor.github.io/) to write my blog posts with relative ease.

The next thing on my blog to-do list is find a way to replace names in post URLs with indices. For that purpose, I decided to ask a question on StackOverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66494261/how-do-i-add-variables-to-a-jekyll-post).

After that, I will add a comment section so you can comment on my posts if you want to.

In the meanwhile, I intend to focus on other things.
