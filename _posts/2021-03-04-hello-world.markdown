This will probably be a somewhat underwhelming first entry, but it's a start.

Hello. My name is Dorijan Cirkveni, also perhaps known as Mouse Potato Does Stuff/Mouse Potato.
I\'m a CS graduate student and am currently interested in topics such as:
-Cryptocurrency
-AI
-Quantum computing
-Web development
and possibly others, and I intend to write about them here.
I will also try improve this blog as I go. For now I am using a default Jekyll blog.
