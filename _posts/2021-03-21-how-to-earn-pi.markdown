This post is a sequel to Stop spamming your Pi Network referrals.
If you haven\'t read it yet, I strongly recommend doing so first.

Okay, so  you filled your security circle. But you still want to earn more Pi and you don\'t want to spam your referral code all over the place to do so. Here are 3 ways you could earn more Pi instead:
- Provide value alongside your referral code.
While most people are unlikely to earn a lot of Pi from referrals, content creators introducing Pi to a lot of people and informing them about it probably have significantly better odds of success. (For example, I used a referral code from a YouTube video reviewing the Pi network.)
- Offer goods and services instead.
Not everyone is good at referral marketing (e.g. me lol). While there is no official marketplace yet, you could participate in the unofficial marketplace known as The Pi Lifestyle. This will also help grow the Pi economy and raise its potential future value in the process.
- Help develop Pi-related applications.
This is the route I, being a mouse potato, am personally considering most. I may also cover this further as I pursue this course of action.

There is one thing all three of these approaches share, and I intend to talk about it in a future article.
